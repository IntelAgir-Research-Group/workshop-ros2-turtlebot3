# UTFPR Francisco Beltr√£o Workshop/Presentations
This repository has been created as a tutorial of how to run ROS 2 with a real Turtlebot 3. This is based on the official ROS 2 [tutorial](https://ros2-industrial-workshop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_source/navigation/ROS2-Turtlebot.html).

## Our Robot
We play with the Turtlebot3 toy robot, which contains a LIDAR sensor and a camera.
